        Experience in managing complex projects. I competently formulate the structure of tasks, using basic and specialized tools that allow me to quickly and clearly control each phase of the project.
        I am able to effectively organize and plan the work process.

        Organization of a sales department from “0”. Experience in bringing new products to market. Development of road maps. Successful experience in creating a small business from “0”. Organization of subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices abroad.
